<p>This visualization tool is the result of a final project for CS 171, Data Visualization, at Harvard University. Using Cloud Cray's <a href="https://github.com/CloudCray/DanceMarkScraper/">DanceMarkScraper</a>, I've aggregated data from <a href="http://www.o2cm.com/">O2CM</a>'s published results from the past seven years, and created a visualization tool that lets you compare results (yours, your friends', or your whole team's) across competitions and years.</p>

<p>There are quite a few things you can do with this tool, but they all boil down to viewing competition results. If you're interested in more than one event (within the same competition or not), you can select a multi-pane view from the options available (I'd give you more, but they don't really fit onto a computer screen very well. Sorry.). Then, select the competition(s) you're interested in (I've got everything that's scrapeable from O2CM), and the specific event(s) within.</p>
<p>Once you're looking at the event you want, you pick out individual couples by rolling over them. Click to highlight -- and, since highlights are copied across panes and kept when you change selections, this is a good way to set up the list of all competitors you're interested in, be that just yourself or your entire team. By way of example, and for my own ease of use, you can load the entire Harvard team with a handy button.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you'd like to isolate just the highlighted competitors, "Selected dancers at top" might be useful to you". Anyway, enjoy! There's 4.2 million marks (from almost 300 comps) out there to explore...</p>
